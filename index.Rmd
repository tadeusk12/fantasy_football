## Fantasy Values

The Fantasy Footballers are a popular podcast with a very large following of loyal listeners.
They release an annual draft ranking, but keep their values for the draft a secret which can be revealed only through their purchasable draft kit. Using SQL and R, I intended to find the values from their free rankings compared to the ADP of ESPN and Sleeper, two of the most popular fantasy football platforms. 

### Sleeper WR Values
```{r wrsleeper, echo = FALSE}

kable(sleeperwr_values)
```
### Sleeper RB Values
```{r sleeper, echo = FALSE}

kable(sleeperrb_values)
```
### ESPN WR Values
```{r wrespn, echo = FALSE}
kable(espnwr_values)
```
### ESPN RB Values
```{r espn, echo = FALSE}
kable(espnrb_values)
```
